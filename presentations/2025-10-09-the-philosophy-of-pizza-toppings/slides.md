Sure, here you go: 

**Presentation Title:** "The Philosophy of Pizza Toppings"

**Subtitle:** "Exploring the Metaphysics of Mozzarella, the Ethics of Extra Cheese, and the Wisdom of White Sauce"

**Slide 1: Introduction - The Existentialism of Extra Cheese**
- Before we dive into toppings, let's take a moment to ponder the existential nature of extra cheese. Is it a topping? Or is it the pizza itself? 
- Extra cheese challenges the norm of what it means to be a topping.
- It insists on being both the main component and an addition, simultaneously raising philosophical questions about identity and classification.

**Slide 2: The Philosophy of Pepperoni Placement**
- Does pepperoni placement impact the pizza's tastiness? Or merely its aesthetics?
- The 'random' vs 'tactical' pepperoni placement debate - a hot topic among pizza philosophers.
- We explore the theory of "pepperoni-spreading" - ensuring every bite has a bit of pepperoni - a philosophical idea rooted in equality and fairness.

**Slide 3: The Metaphysics of Mushrooms**
- The "Fungus Among Us": Mushrooms, the most polarizing pizza topping; let's delve into their metaphysical implications.
- If one whole mushroom is cut into slices, is each slice still the original mushroom? Or do they take on a new mushroom identity?
- What does this tell us about the nature of existence and objects? 

**Slide 4: The Anarchy of Anchovies**
- Anchovies - the rebels of pizza toppings, testing the limits of public acceptance.
- Is putting fish on a pizza an act of culinary anarchy or a maligned innovation?
- We'll discuss the philosophy of anchovies and the concept of challenging societal norms.

**Slide 5: The Purity of Pineapple**
- The 'pineapple on pizza' debate - a philosophical quagmire that has divided the world.
- Are we bound by tradition in our choice of toppings, or can we explore new realms of flavor? 
- Can the sweet meet the savory on our pizza, or is there a 'purity of purpose' that pizza should maintain?

**Slide 6: Conclusion - The Diversity of Toppings**
- Pizza toppings as an analogy for the diverse cultures and tastes of the world.
- The 'perfect pizza' is subjective – we all bring our unique expectations and preferences to the table.
- Just like pizza toppings, we should appreciate and celebrate diversity, one slice at a time. 

**Slide 7: Food for Thought**
- What do our pizza toppings say about us?
- How do our choices reflect our personality, our upbringing, our worldview?
- Next time you decide to have a pizza, take a moment to contemplate the philosophy of your chosen toppings. Remember, you are what you eat!
