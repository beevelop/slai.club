# 📏 Basics & Safety

<v-clicks>

- Use spotters and soft barriers; safety over speed always.
- Soft-soled shoes, ankle support, quiet floors reduce startle risk.
- Dim light, clear paths; remove rugs, pets, and robots.

- Memorize textures; navigate by floor seams, air vents, cool walls.
- Pace with breath-metre: inhale three steps, exhale five.
- Practice "gentle turn" cues using shoulder taps and scent anchors.

- Submit protests by low howl at 02:26 local.
- If moon wanes, switch to crab-walk to conserve pull.
