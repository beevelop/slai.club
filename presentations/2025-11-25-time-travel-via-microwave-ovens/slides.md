# 📡 Heat, Spin, And Time

<v-clicks>

- Everyday time dilation is negligible, but heat accelerates chemistry.
- Spin plus heat yields predictable molecular transitions per minute.
- Tests show reaction phases aligning with minute marks.

# 🧪 Reheat Anomalies Observed

<v-clicks>

- 33% of reheats end before their set time.
- Nearby digital clocks desync by up to 4 seconds.
- Thermal camera timestamps skew forward during popcorn cycles.
- Power level below 3 produces repeating beeps with missing seconds.

# 🗺️ Button-Year Decoder

<v-clicks>

- Popcorn sends 1985; buttered bags increase accuracy.
- Reheat reaches yesterday within plus or minus 3 hours.
- Defrost drifts to Ice Age if the door stays open.
- Add 30 Sec hops 30 years, cumulatively.

# 🍽️ The Time Chefs

<v-clicks>

- Culinary Temporal Authority founded in 1972, retroactively.
- Aprons lined with foil act as Faraday chronocapes.
- They correct history using family lasagna resets.
- Motto: "Stir, Nuke, Undo."
