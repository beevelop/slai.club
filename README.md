## 🎯 What is this madness?

**slai.club** is an automated PowerPoint Karaoke generator that uses AI to create completely unique, often absurd, always entertaining presentations. Each day, the AI picks a random topic, crafts a compelling (and increasingly ridiculous) narrative, generates custom images, and deploys it to the web.

Think of it as:
- 🎪 **PowerPoint Karaoke** meets **AI Chaos**
- 🎭 **Storytelling** with **Unexpected Plot Twists**
- 🎨 **Art** created by **Sentient Algorithms** (probably)
- 🎲 **Daily Surprises** you didn't know you needed

### 🌟 Why does this exist?

Because someone has to keep PowerPoint Karaoke fresh, and that someone is an AI. Every morning, a new presentation appears. No human involvement. Just pure algorithmic creativity with a dash of conspiracy theories and a sprinkle of aliens.

## 🎪 The Magic Formula

```
🤖 GPT-5 + 🎨 FLUX Schnell + 📊 Slidev = 🎭 Daily Chaos
```

Each presentation follows a **5-Act Dramatic Structure**:

1. **Act 1**: Seems totally normal (you're hooked)
2. **Act 2**: Things get... interesting
3. **Act 3**: 🛸 **THE PLOT TWIST** (WHAT?!)
4. **Act 4**: Double down on the absurdity
5. **Act 5**: Peak chaos achieved
